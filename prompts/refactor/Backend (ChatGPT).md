# Backend Refactor Prompt

> Refactor the entire Express.js server folder for better maintainability, performance, and readability. This folder includes API route definitions, middleware, controller logic, and utility functions.
>
> ✅ Goals:
> – Modularize the codebase: split large files into smaller, purpose-driven modules
> – Improve code structure: organize routes, controllers, and middleware into a clean, scalable directory layout
> – Replace repetitive patterns with reusable functions or middleware
> – Use modern ES6+ syntax throughout (e.g., `import/export`, arrow functions)
> – Ensure robust error handling using centralized error middleware
> – Apply consistent naming conventions and remove unused code
> – Clean and optimize Express.js setup: clear separation of app initialization, route registration, and server startup
>
> ✅ Bonus if you can:
> – Add types using JSDoc or convert to TypeScript if recommended
> – Implement request validation using `zod` or `Joi` where needed
> – Add comments to clarify logic in critical parts of the app
>
> The folder may contain files like `index.js`, `server.js`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `utils/`, and `config/`. The output should include a cleaned-up and modular server codebase with improved maintainability and best practices applied.
